*A fun and educational way to monitor your phone's temperature!*

## 📱 About ChickClick
ChickClick is a unique and humorous smartphone battery health monitoring app. It simulates egg incubation based on your device's temperature, offering a playful way to learn about temperature monitoring while enjoying a virtual pet experience.

Our mission is to provide an engaging way to track phone usage and temperature through an entertaining concept!

## 🐣 How It Works
The app has three fun conditions based on your phone’s temperature and usage:
- **🥚 Egg** – Your device is cool, and the egg is safely incubating.
- **🐔 Chicken** – If your phone’s temperature is just right, you successfully hatch a chicken!
- **🍳 Omelet** – If your phone overheats due to excessive usage, well… say hello to an omelet! 😂

## 🚀 Features
- Monitors device temperature in a fun and interactive way.
- Encourages mindful phone usage.
- Hilarious animations and visuals.
- Developed using **React Native Expo** and **TypeScript**.
- Currently available for **Android** only.

## 🎉 Origin Story
ChickClick was initially created during a **hackathon at our campus**, called *The Useless Project*. It started as an idea by our talented juniors:

- **James Aldrin D’Cunja**
- **Muhammed Nadeer K N**
- **Amrith Raj M M**

During the hackathon, they attempted to build it using **Kotlin** but couldn't complete it. Seeing their passion and effort, I decided to help bring their vision to life with React Native. Today, I’m thrilled to say that ChickClick is fully functional, and all the credit goes to them for their brilliant and fun idea!
